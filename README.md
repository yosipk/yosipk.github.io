# Who am I?

I'm Josip Krapac. From mid-2019 I work in Zalando and work on natural language understanding with emphasis on 
* undestanding customer feedback and 
* improving product search by understanding natural language queries.

My research background is in computer vision, with emphasis on image classification and semantic segmentation.
